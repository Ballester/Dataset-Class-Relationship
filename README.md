# Dataset Class Relationship
### Finds the relationship between the classes of two datasets based on synsets and names

In this example ImageNet and TU-Berlin Sketch dataset are being matched, resulting in their intersecting classes.
The results can be used for correct embedding on fine-tuning a target dataset in Domain Adaptation scenarios. Further explanation is given on github.com/ballester/lateral-representation-learning

Requirements:
  * NLTK with wordnet
